Analysis:

The goal is to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. We will use machine learning and neural netwarks to make this prediction.

Results:
EIN and NAME were removed becasue they were neither targets nor features. After removing them, the remaining columns are considered features for the model.
The target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL".

Compliling:
After applying the training model we managed to get close to the target at 72%.

Optimization:
For the second attempt, we added "NAME" back and we were able to go over the target at 78%.
